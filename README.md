#**FaceMash** - (My Version)

Facemash was a website that was made by a very drunk Mark Zuckerberg during his days as a sophomore at Harvard.

It accessed the digital directories of dorms and pulled the pictures of all female students into its own private directory.

It put pictures of two women side by side and prompted the user to pick a woman based on their attractiveness.

It would then carry forward the selected woman and display another woman for the user to choose from.

The entire process was fetured in his biopic: The Social Network(2010) 

[IMDb page]("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/").

Here's the scene from the actual movie:

My version of this site is not going to be the same.

I'm going to bulid a similar site which compares something different such as for a place to start: Holiday Destinations (To keep the site clean)
